            <h3>Informal Resolution</h3>
            <p>
              Before pursuing formal legal action, parties agree to attempt resolution through 
              direct negotiation and good faith discussions.
            </p>

            <h3>Mediation</h3>
            <p>
              If informal resolution fails, disputes will be submitted to binding mediation 
              through a mutually agreed mediator or mediation service.
            </p>

            <h3>Arbitration</h3>
            <p>
              Disputes not resolved through mediation may be subject to binding arbitration 
              according to the rules of the American Arbitration Association.
            </p>

            <h3>Exceptions</h3>
            <p>The following disputes are not subject to arbitration:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Claims for injunctive relief</li>
              <li>Intellectual property disputes</li>
              <li>Small claims court matters</li>
              <li>Statutory claims that cannot be arbitrated</li>

            <p>
              These Terms and any disputes arising from them will be governed by the laws of 
              the State of [Your State] without regard to conflict of law principles.
            </p>

            <p>
              Any legal proceedings will be conducted in the state and federal courts located

            <p>
